class ModbusPort;

/*! \brief Implements direct control for `ModbusPort` derived classes (TCP or serial) for server side.

    \details `ModbusServerResource` derived from `ModbusServerPort` and
    makes `ModbusPort` object behaves like server port.
    Pointer to `ModbusPort` object is passed to `ModbusServerResource` constructor.

    Also `ModbusServerResource` have `ModbusInterface` object as second parameter
    of constructor which process every Modbus function request.

    Key characteristics:
    - Concrete implementation of ModbusServerPort for single-connection scenarios
    - Wraps any ModbusPort (TCP, RTU, ASCII) for server-side operation
    - Delegates all Modbus function processing to ModbusInterface device
    - Manages complete request-response lifecycle
    - Supports all standard Modbus functions through device delegation
    - Works with any protocol through polymorphic port interface
    - Ideal for simple server implementations and serial protocols
    
    This implementation provides:
    - Automatic server mode configuration for the wrapped port
    - Complete request processing pipeline (input → device → output)
    - Protocol-agnostic operation through ModbusPort abstraction
    - Pass-through of port configuration (timeout, type, open/close)
    - Three-stage processing: input parsing, device execution, output assembly
    - Error handling and status propagation throughout processing stages
    - Signal forwarding from underlying port (open/close, Tx/Rx, errors)
    
    Request processing workflow:
    1. process() is called repeatedly in application loop
    2. Port reads incoming data (processInputData)
    3. Request is parsed and validated
    4. Device processes the Modbus function (processDevice)
    5. Response is assembled (processOutputData)
    6. Port writes response back to client
    
    The three-stage processing architecture:
    - processInputData(): Receives and parses incoming request from port buffer
    - processDevice(): Delegates function execution to ModbusInterface device
    - processOutputData(): Assembles and prepares response in port buffer
    
    This separation allows derived classes to customize each stage while maintaining
    the overall processing flow.
    
    Usage scenarios:
    - Serial port servers (RTU/ASCII) with single connection
    - Simple TCP servers for single-client applications
    - Testing and development environments
    - Embedded systems with resource constraints
    - Protocol adapters and gateways
    
    For TCP servers requiring multiple simultaneous connections, use ModbusTcpServer
    instead, which manages multiple connections with separate ModbusServerResource
    instances per connection.
