/*! \brief Abstract base class for direct control of `ModbusPort` derived classes (TCP or serial) for server side.

    \details Pointer to `ModbusPort` object must be passed to `ModbusServerPort`
    derived class constructor.

    Also assumed that `ModbusServerPort` derived classes must accept `ModbusInterface`
    object in its constructor to process every Modbus function request.

    Key characteristics:
    - Abstract base class for server-side port implementations
    - Controls underlying ModbusPort for server operation
    - Delegates Modbus function processing to ModbusInterface device
    - Supports unit address filtering through unit map mechanism
    - Provides broadcast mode support for unit address 0
    - Event-driven architecture with signal callbacks
    - Asynchronous operation through process() method
    
    This base class provides:
    - Device management for request delegation to ModbusInterface implementation
    - Port lifecycle control (open, close, state checking)
    - Timeout configuration for read operations
    - Unit map filtering (256-bit bitmap for addresses 0-255)
    - Broadcast mode enablement for address 0
    - Context storage for user-defined data association
    - Signal emission for open/close, Tx/Rx, and error events
    - State management for connection status
    
    The class establishes the server-side architecture:
    1. ModbusServerPort wraps a ModbusPort and controls it in server mode
    2. Incoming requests are read from the port
    3. Requests are delegated to the ModbusInterface device for processing
    4. Responses are written back through the port
    5. Signals notify about communication events
    
    Unit map filtering:
    The unit map is a 32-byte bitmap (256 bits) where each bit represents a unit address.
    - Bit set (1): Unit address is enabled and requests will be processed
    - Bit clear (0): Unit address is disabled and requests will be ignored
    - Not set (nullptr): All unit addresses are accepted (default behavior)
    
    This allows selective enabling of unit addresses, useful when a single server
    manages multiple logical devices or when security requires limiting accessible units.
    
    Process-driven operation:
    The process() method must be called repeatedly in the application's main loop.
    It performs non-blocking I/O operations and request handling, returning status
    codes that indicate the current state (good, processing, error). This design
    enables integration with event loops and asynchronous architectures without
    blocking the application.
    
    Context storage:
    The context pointer allows applications to associate custom data with the server
    port instance, useful for callbacks and signal handlers that need access to
    application-specific state without global variables.
